        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups slightly warm water</li>\
            <li>1/2 cup dill pickle juice</li>
            <li>3 1/2 cups bread flour</li>
            <li> 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese (optional for all you lactose people, which is most of earths population)</li>
            <li> 1/4 cup diced dill pickles, add more or less depending on taste preferences</li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon dried dill weed</li>
            <li> cooking spray</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sea salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Step by step instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in water and pickle juice in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form bubbles, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add flour, Cheddar cheese, pickles, olive oil, and dill to yeast mixture. Mix with the dough hook on medium speed until smooth and elastic, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Coat a slow cooker insert with cooking spray. Shape dough into a loaf, place in slow cooker, and sprinkle the top with sea salt. Drape a thin kitchen towel, cheesecloth, or paper towel over the slow cooker before adding the lid. This will keep any moisture from dripping onto the bread.</li>
            <li>Let dough rise for 1 hour 30 minutes. Turn slow cooker on Low for 15 minutes; turn off and let rise another 1 hour 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cook on High for 1 hour 30 minutes. Reduce heat to Low and cook until bottom of bread is browned, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let bread cool before slicing, placing loaf on its side or on a wire rack to keep the bottom from getting soggy.</li>
        </ol>
