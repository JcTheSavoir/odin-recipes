        <h3>Grilled Pb & J</h3>
        <p> This recipe is designed to turn your ordinary, run of the mill, ancient sandwich into this year's new hot commodity.  Sure you have had grilled cheese before, maybe you've even had a grilled peanut butter sandwich before.  But, I bet you never even thought of how good a grilled Pb&J could be.</p>
        <p> If you are hesitant to try this, I'd normally say "I get it, who'd want hot jelly anyways?".  That was before I had tried it myself, and before I added that super tasty looking picture to this webpage.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
            <li>2 slices white bread</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon peanut butter</li>
            <li>2 teaaspoons any flavor fruit jelly (except prune jelly, does not heat well)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat griddle or skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Spread butter on one side of each slice of bread. Spread peanut butter on unbuttered side of one slice of bread, and jelly on the other. Place one slice, buttered side down on the griddle. Top with other slice, so that peanut butter and jelly are in the middle. Cook for 4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown, and heated through.</li>
        </ol>
